# basketball_stats_django

The concept is to create a simple crud app to access and edit a system which encludes teams, players and scores(player's). 
After the crud is ready some analytics needs to be implemented based on the scores. 
After the analytics some visualization is a great asset.

app_structure is for better django understanding
model_association is for better concept understanding
